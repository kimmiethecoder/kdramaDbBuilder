<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDb, Express</p>

<p>This db builder gives me the ability to add documents to my Mongodb without needing to create every key within the database itself.
Can also delete entries and update specific properties on entered documents.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>The importance of dotenv and gitignore files. Also how sensitive Mongodb is to casing and spacing.
Lots of debugging and assistance from my community of developers.</p>
